# CHANGELOG - v0.3.0

## Migration & Compatibility
- **Migrated Trackpad Drivers to ZMK v0.3.0 (Zephyr 3.5)**
  - The workflow was updated and version v0.3.0 of zmk was fixed for the compilation
  - Updated Avago A320 (`a320_0x57.c`) driver headers and API calls for Zephyr 3.5 compliance.
  - Refactored includes to use new namespaced headers (e.g., `<zephyr/kernel.h>` instead of `<kernel.h>`).
  - Validated integration with the latest ZMK Input Subsystem.
  - Resolved `Kconfig` and `Devicetree` deprecation warnings.

## Technical Improvements
- **Maintained Feature Parity**:
  - Preserved existing Smart Modes (Scroll via CapsLock, Precision via Ctrl).
  - Preserved dynamic sensitivity scaling.
- **Codebase Clean-up**:
  - Modernized `gpio_dt_spec` usage.
  - Ensured correct `DT_DRV_COMPAT` definitions for the new build system.
